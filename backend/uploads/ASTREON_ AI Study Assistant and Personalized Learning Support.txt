The diagram involves four key actors: the Student (a useraccessing course content), the Teacher (an educator managing educational material), theSE | Systems Requirements Specification25Astreon: AI Study Assistant and Personalized Learning SupportSystems Requirements SpecificationsStudy Buddy (the primary system facilitating user actions), and the Database (storing userdata, schedules, files, quiz results, and progress).The interaction flow begins with the login process, where students or teachers submit logincredentials. Study Buddy verifies these credentials with the database, resulting in eithersuccessful access or an unsuccessful login notification. Once logged in, users can createschedules such as study timetables or quiz schedules, which the system stores in thedatabase along with associated course information. The file upload process allows users,primarily teachers, to upload course materials or resources, with the system storing thesefiles and returning either success or failure messages.Content creation represents another key interaction, where users can create or requestcontent like quizzes or personalized learning material, which is stored in the database andmade available for use. Students then interact with this content through quizzes orflashcards, with questions presented in a loop until completion and responses stored in thedatabase. After completing activities, the system presents results by retrieving stored data,providing either positive feedback for scores above a threshold (e.g., 75%) or constructivefeedback for improvement when scores fall below the threshold.The final major interaction involves progress tracking, where students can request to viewtheir grades and quiz history, with Study Buddy fetching and displaying this data from thedatabase. Notable observations from the diagram include its emphasis on feedback-drivenlearning with continuous improvement through quizzes and personalized feedback, whilethe teacher's role focuses primarily on resource provision as students engage with contentand monitor their progress.SE | Systems Requirements Specification26Astreon: AI Study Assistant and Personalized Learning SupportSystems Requirements SpecificationsActivity DiagramSE | Systems Requirements Specification27Astreon: AI Study Assistant and Personalized Learning SupportSystems Requirements SpecificationsFig 1.4 Activity DiagramThe activity diagram for the Astreon project illustrates the interaction flow betweenstudents, professors, and the system, with a focus on personalized content delivery andevaluation. The process initiates when a user logs into the system, after which the flowSE | Systems Requirements Specification28Astreon: AI Study Assistant and Personalized Learning SupportSystems Requirements Specificationsdiverges into two distinct paths based on the user's role: students are directed to theStudent Input Module for system interaction, while professors access the Professor InputModule for content management and input provision.Once user input is received, the system analyzes the content by gathering and processingdata to understand user needs and actions. This analysis leads to the creation ofpersonalized content tailored to individual student requirements. The generated contentthen undergoes a review and approval process by professors to ensure quality andrelevance. If approved, the content moves forward in the process; if not, it returns to thecontent creation stage for refinement.After approval, the content is delivered to students for engagement, allowing them to studyand complete exercises. The system provides immediate feedback or grades based onstudent performance. If students are unsatisfied with their results or fail to meetrequirements, the system offers options to retry or re-engage with the content. Additionally,professors can create scheduled quizzes for further student evaluation. The processculminates with the display of final grades upon completion of all activities.This diagram for Astreon, demonstrating an educational platform designed to deliverpersonalized learning experiences, facilitate continuous assessment and feedback, andenable professors to curate and review learning materials. The flow ensures acomprehensive learning experience while maintaining quality through professor oversightand allowing for student improvement through multiple attempts.SE | Systems Requirements Specification29Astreon: AI Study Assistant and Personalized Learning SupportSystems Requirements SpecificationsUse-case DiagramFig 1.5 Use Case DiagramThis diagram provides a visual representation of interactions between users (actors) andsystem functionalities (use cases), organized in multiple layers to show both core andoptional system operations.
